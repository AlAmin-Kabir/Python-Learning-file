Here I am going to using the range function.
Uses of range function-
    1. For iterating large amount of numbers.
Format of range function-
    a) If wants to print from 1 to n... --- range(n+1)
Example:
for talika in range(10):
    print(talika)

    b) For printing from one number to another... --- range(m,n)
Example:
for talika in range(5,10):
    print(talika)
    b) For printing from one number to another...with a sequence... --- range(m,n,sequence)
Example:
for talika in range(5,10,2):
    print(talika)
